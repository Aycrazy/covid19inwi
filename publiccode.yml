    longDescription: >
      A list of links to local information and resources about COVID-19. 
      Comprehensive listing of local resources for Wisconsin.  Most
      comprehensive for Milwaukee.  Hope to add multimedia elements as well. 
      Data analysis is also included in the data portion.  It gives current
      counts on people tested for Covid19, deaths, and projections for each
      respectively.  This is completely open to community contributions and is
      meant to be replicable for other localities around the country and the
      world.  Thank you!
